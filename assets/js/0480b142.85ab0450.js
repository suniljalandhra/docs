In the context of VEX, zk-proofs are generated for all transactions, and these proofs are then settled and verifiable on-chain. Because only the proof \u2014 not the full transaction details \u2014 is exposed, the chances of MEV attacks like frontrunning and sandwich attacks are drastically reduced as searchers and node operators can only see that a transaction is valid, but they can\u2019t see sensitive information like the exact timing or full trade details.
