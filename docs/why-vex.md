Every financial exchange is typically built on 2 core components:

1. Trade matching: which brings together supply and demand for different assets (Orderbooks/AMMs/Intents).

2. Trade settlement: which settles all trades (Banks and Blockchains). 

Historically and even today, all traditional financial exchanges still have both components centralized. With the rise of blockchains and crypto, the industry saw a change: Centralized exchanges continued the traditional model while decentralized exchange moved both trade matching and settlement on blockchain.  

But this evolution introduced issues like: 

**The Trust Problem with Centralized Exchanges**

Centralized exchanges dominate market share and offer high performance, but none of it matters if they're operated behind closed doors, lacking transparency and security. History proves this — collapses like FTX ($8B+ lost), Mt. Gox ($450M lost), and hacks like WazirX ($235M) have exposed the risks of centralized custodial models.

**The Performance Limitations of Decentralized Exchanges**

While DEXs solve custody issues, they introduce major performance constraints by executing everything on-chain, leading to:

- Low transaction throughput (typically 10-50 TPS per pair)

- High gas fees for complex orders

- Limited order types

- Chain-specific liquidity fragmentation

**The Problem of Cross-Chain Fragmentation**

Existing exchanges often require assets to be wrapped in chain-specific tokens, causing:

- Liquidity fragmentation across chains

- Bridging risks

- Complexity for users dealing with multiple asset versions

**Why VEX exists?**

VEX was created to specifically built to solve the contradiction in crypto trading: performance v/s security. As for the longest time, exchanges have been forced to compromise one for the other. And here's how VEX changes that:  

**1. Provable Orderbooks**

VEX uses an off-chain order matching engine, achieving performance 100x faster than DEXs. Every trade generates a zero-knowledge proof, verifiable on-chain, guaranteeing execution fairness through mathematical proof — not trust.

**2. Non-Custodial by Design**

Funds remain fully under your control at all times. Trading permissions are delegated to VEX with strict cryptographic limits. You can force withdraw anytime if verification fails, eliminating custody risk entirely.

**3. Native Asset Trading**

Because VEX operates off-chain, it isn't bound by blockchains to offer wrapped tokens. You can trade any native token with any native token, with native settlement on their respective chains.

**Our vision: The future is Verifiable, Secure and Performant.**

As centralized exchanges continue to get hacked and DEXs struggle with performance and MEV, we believe the future of trading is verifiable. A future where every transaction is secured with zk-proofs, performance is no longer limited by blockchain bottlenecks, and every trade is provably safe and verifiable on-chain.
