VEX is a verifiable exchange specifically built to solve the contradiction in crypto trading between performance and security. As for the longest time, exchanges have had fundamental flaws in how they were designed.

**Our vision: The future is Verifiable, Secure and Performant**

As centralized exchanges continue to get hacked and on-chain exchanges struggle with performance and MEV, we believe the future of trading is verifiable. A future where every transaction is secured with zk-proofs, performance is no longer limited by blockchain bottlenecks, and every trade is provably safe and verifiable on-chain.

**The Trust Problem with Centralized Exchanges**

Centralized exchanges dominate market share and offer high performance, but none of it matters if they're operated behind closed doors, lacking transparency and security. History proves this — collapses like FTX ($8B+ lost), Mt. Gox ($450M lost), and hacks like WazirX ($235M) have exposed the risks of centralized custodial models.

**The Performance Limitations of Decentralized Exchanges**

While DEXs solve custody issues, they introduce major performance constraints by executing everything on-chain, leading to:

- Low transaction throughput (typically 10-50 TPS per pair)

- High gas fees for complex orders

- Limited order types

- Chain-specific liquidity fragmentation

**The Problem of Cross-Chain Fragmentation**

Existing exchanges often require assets to be wrapped in chain-specific tokens, causing:

- Liquidity fragmentation across chains

- Bridging risks

- Complexity for users dealing with multiple asset versions

This is why VEX was created — to address all these bottlenecks through: 

**1. Provable Orderbooks**

VEX uses an off-chain order matching engine, achieving performance 100x faster than DEXs. Every trade generates a zero-knowledge proof, verifiable on-chain, guaranteeing execution fairness through mathematical proof — not trust.

**2. Non-Custodial by Design**

Funds remain fully under your control at all times. Trading permissions are delegated to VEX with strict cryptographic limits. You can force withdraw anytime if verification fails, eliminating custody risk entirely.

**3. Native Asset Trading**

Because VEX operates off-chain, it isn't bound by blockchains to offer wrapped tokens. You can trade any native token with any native token, with native settlement on their respective chains.
