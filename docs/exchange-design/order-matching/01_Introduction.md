# Introduction

Order matching lies at the core of any financial exchange — it’s the process that pairs buyers and sellers and executes trades. However, in centralized systems, this crucial component often operates as a black box. Users have no visibility into whether their orders were matched fairly, if they were front-run, or whether the exchange manipulated the trade flow.

This documentation focuses on the concept and design of a **provable order matching system** that blends the efficiency of traditional centralized exchanges (CEXs) with cryptographic guarantees. The goal is to offer a high-throughput, low-latency, and **verifiably fair** order matching mechanism using **Indexed Merkle Trees (IMTs)** and **cryptographic proofs**.
