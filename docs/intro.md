VEX is a Verifiable Exchange created for high-speed trading, where near-instant performance is combined with full on-chain verifiability of trades. At its core, VEX uses off-chain orderbooks that are fully verifiable on-chain through zero-knowledge proofs, processing over 8,000 transactions per second per trading pair, supporting native asset-to-asset trading, and remaining fully non-custodial by design.

**The future of trading is powered by ZK.**

Zero-knowledge proofs are one of the most critical technologies driving blockchain scalability and privacy â€” and now, we're bringing them to trading. Historically, building ZKP systems was extremely complicated, requiring deep cryptographic expertise and years to reach production. Today, ZK is ready to go mainstream - delivering speed, security, and verifiability without compromise.
