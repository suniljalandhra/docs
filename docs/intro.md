VEX is a Verifiable Exchange created for high-speed trading, where near-instant performance is combined with full on-chain verifiability of trades. At its core, VEX uses off-chain orderbooks that are fully verifiable on-chain through zero-knowledge proofs, processing over 8,000 transactions per second per trading pair, supporting native asset-to-asset trading, and remaining fully non-custodial by design.

**The future of trading is powered by ZK.**

Zero-knowledge proofs have long been recognized as a critical breakthrough for blockchain scalability and privacy. For years, the technology remained largely theoretical â€” discussed in research papers but difficult to implement in real-world systems due to its complexity. Following significant advancements, although still challenging, VEX brings zero-knowledge proofs into its infrastructure, applying them at scale to guarantee transparent, trustless trading without compromising performance.
