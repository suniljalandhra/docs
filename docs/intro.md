**The future of exchanges is ZK.**

Zero-knowledge proofs are one of the most critical technologies driving blockchain scalability and privacy — and now, we're bringing them to exchanges. As historically, building ZKP systems was extremely complicated, requiring deep cryptographic expertise and years to reach production. But now, ZK is here to truly reshape how traders interact with exchanges — and VEX is here to prove it. 

VEX is a Verifiable Exchange created for high speed trading environment while being secure and transparent through blockchains and zk-proofs. At its core, VEX uses off-chain orderbooks that are fully verifiable on-chain through zero-knowledge proofs, processing over 8,000 transactions per second per trading pair, supporting native asset-to-asset swaps, and remaining fully non-custodial by design.

Built to set the new foundation for trading, VEX brings the scalable, trustless experience — combining near-instant performance, full on-chain verifiability and universal native asset support. The future of trading isn't just decentralized. It's verifiable. And it's already here.
