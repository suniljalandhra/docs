VEX is an exchange that brings the speed of off-chain trading with the security and transparency of blockchains — solving what both DEXs and CEXs couldn’t.  

At it's core it uses off-chain orderbooks that are fully verifiable on-chain with zk-proofs, processing 8000+ transactions per second - per pair, supporting native asset-to-asset trading, while remaining fully non-custodial.
